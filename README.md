Simple Recipe Page

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of the curriculum from The Odin Project and serves as an introduction to basic HTML and web development. The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe website, where you can view a collection of recipes, each with its own dedicated page.

## Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
- Creating a structured HTML document with headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
- Organizing files and directories for a web project.
- Linking multiple web pages together.
- Using relative and absolute paths in links.


This project will help solidify my understanding of HTML structure and improve your ability to create simple yet functional web pages. Happy coding!
