    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lumpia is a Filipino-style spring roll that is a popular appetizer and snack. These crispy rolls are filled with a mixture of ground meat, vegetables, and seasonings, then deep-fried to perfection. Lumpia is enjoyed for its crunchy texture and flavorful filling, often served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g ground pork or beef</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped cabbage</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>25 lumpia wrappers</li>
        <li>Cooking oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, chopped carrots, cabbage, onion, garlic, soy sauce, oyster sauce, beaten egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Lay a lumpia wrapper on a flat surface. Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling near one corner of the wrapper, shaping it into a log.</li>
        <li>Fold the corner of the wrapper over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll tightly to form a spring roll. Moisten the edge with water to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Fry the lumpia in batches until they are golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve the lumpia hot with sweet and sour dipping sauce. Enjoy!</li>
